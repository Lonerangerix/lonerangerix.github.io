					<p>Arrow a Row is my first complete game that I released on Steam, with over 1.1 million downloads. I designed, modeled and coded the whole game by myself.</p>

				<p><br>The development of Arrow a Row was mostly driven by the requests from my subscribers. I first did an early version of it and posted it on bilibili. The video
					is <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1r14y1F7qs" target="_blank">here</a>. That game and video blew up and people liked it a lot, requesting me to do an update.
					<br><br>
					So I went about modeling new enemies, bosses, and powerups, and adding them to the game. At this point, I felt like the game was coming together and I always wanted to
					do a steam release. I thought I might as well just use it to pave my way into the world of steam development. After finishing the overall game mechanicss, I thought I should
					implement a localization to the game. So I continued learning how to do that. Then I thought, it might be to cool to have achievements system. So I did lots of icons in Photoshop
					and integrated the achivement system into the game, both within the game and with the steam API.

				The game was hitting about 8000 concurrent players in the first couple days of its release, and I guess most of them were my subscribers but there were also many international 
				friends, thanks to my localization in 9 languages. People liked the game overall and I am really proud of it.
				<br><br>
				During the development, I was able to get my hands on so many useful features and learn loads of stuff, like localization, steam API, game balancing, marketing and so on.
				It is totally free. Feel free to check it out: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2495980" target="_blank"><b><i>Arrow a Row on Steam</i></b></a>
